# The Sea Cleaning Claw Machine
 
This game was made for the SEAJAM hosted by polymars where the theme is all about see preservation and stuff like that. Its all in support of the #TeamSeas initiative hosted by Mr. Beast and Mark Rober.

In the game you play as a claw machine that has to pickup trash from the bottom of the ocean and drop it in the recycling hole.
